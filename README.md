# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification  

This project classifies **Iris flowers** into three species — *Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica* — using machine learning models.  
It includes an interactive **Streamlit web app** where you can input flower measurements and get predictions instantly.

## 📂 Dataset  
The project uses the famous **Iris dataset** with 150 samples and 4 features:  
- `sepal_length` (cm)  
- `sepal_width` (cm)  
- `petal_length` (cm)  
- `petal_width` (cm)  

Target variable:  
- `species` → *Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica*

## ⚙️ Features  
✔ Data preprocessing & standardization  
✔ Train-test split (80-20)  
✔ Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)  
✔ Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report  
✔ Comparison of model performance  
✔ **Streamlit app** with sliders for real-time predictions  
✔ Saves the **best model** (`iris_best_model.pkl`)
